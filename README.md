# Dholuo-App
Dholuo app introduces you to Dholuo through a collection of basic vocabularies and phrases with their respective pronunciation in audio form.  Given that written Dholuo lacks phonetics guide, the audios are a lead on how to utter Dholuo words, that will set you up for proper pronunciations while attempting to make your first Dholuo conversations.  The app has four categories where users may scroll through each of them and challenge themselves by reading, listen to the translation, and practicing the pronunciations.
What I did:
Used Android Studio IDE to build an application that applies a User Interface with a
MenuItem, a ViewPager that fetches data from a Customized FragmentPagerAdapter,
Tabs, Fragments, TextViews, and Audio Raw Files that utilize View Recycling via
ListView, ListItem, Custom Class and Custom ArrayAdapter.
● Its’ Importance:

It is a Dholuo Tutorial that has Dholuo translations against their respective English
words, with accompanying audio, which offers Dholuo pronunciation guidelines.
Each list_item responds to user clicks by playing the Raw Audio File attached to it.
● Its’ Competence:
It offers Dholuo pronunciation in audio form to top its tutorial capacities since written
Dholuo lacks phonetic guidelines.
● Its’ Impact:
It accompanies Dholuo words with their pronunciation to boost learning, especially
for users who are interested in speaking the language and have to teach themselves for
lacking the privilege of being around fluent Dholuo speakers.
